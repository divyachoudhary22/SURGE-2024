Title: Two-Scale Thermo-Mechanical Analysis of Integrated Thermal Protection System Panels for Reusable Launch Vehicles

Abstract:
We aim at mitigating thermal energy transfer-induced deformations in reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). Launch vehicles experience substantial thermal energy transfer during reentry, leading to thermal expansion and structural deformation, particularly in corrugated panels. To address this issue, an Integrated Thermal Protection System (ITPS) is employed to impede heat transfer and safeguard various components of the RLV. Leveraging existing data and codes pertaining to the thermal and mechanical behaviors of corrugated structures, our research aims to homogenize these characteristics into a singular plate. This homogenization process will involve extrapolating the thermal transfer, bending, and other pertinent properties from the complex 3D corrugated structure to a simplified 2D plate configuration. By establishing a mean representation of heat transfer within the plate, our objective is to facilitate the translation of findings onto actual components of the RLV. Central to our investigation is the transfer of thermal characteristics from a single corrugated structure to a broader segment of the RLV, ensuring enhanced structural integrity and performance under extreme thermal conditions. Through this, we aim to contribute novel insights towards the advancement of thermal management strategies, ultimately bolstering the reliability and resilience of future launch vehicle systems.
